A recreation of the TED home page without using Flash

Why?
---
I love watching TED Talks and sometimes when I visit the home page,
the featured talks section causes the browser to freeze because of
the Adobe Flash player. This is rather frustrating and so I wondered
if implementing it with HTML5/CSS and JavaScript would help to 
make it load faster.

In addition to that, it also seemed like a nice little project to 
practice HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and learn about SASS.
